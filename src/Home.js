        <h4>Hi there,</h4>
        <p>I'm a student studying concurrently at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University working towards an <b>Honours Bachelor of Computer Science</b> and an <b>Honours Bachelor of Business Administration</b> respectively. </p>
 
        <p>I will graduate in 2021 with five four-month internships. So far, I've worked as a <b>DevOps Engineer</b> at Camis inc. and a <b>Software Developer</b> at BMO Capital Markets. </p>

        <p>I'm a <b>Canadian citizen</b> and a <b>permanent resident of the United States</b>, willing to work anywhere in the world that will offer me a great learning experience and a chance to better myself and others. </p>

        <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me eagerly awaiting the next season of Game of Thrones, rewatching The Office for the 10th time, trying a new Shawarma place, or playing Rocket League/Fortnite/FIFA with my friends. I <i>love</i> playing board games; my favourites right now are Coup and The Resistance. In the summer, I like to coach house-league soccer.</p>
